- Sophomore at Caltech studying computer science with a minor in mathematics and information and data sciences
- interested in applying <u>sophisticated mathematical principles</u> to elevate the <u>precision and robustness of AI models</u> while simultaneously exploring mathematical methods that can expedite AI execution while preserving accuracy

<h3 align="center">Current Research Interests</h3>

My research interests keep evolving (from protein-protein interactions via. a structural biology perspective to applied machine learning for protein fitness prediction to etc.)

Here is what I am currently interested in at the moment.

- I am particularly interested <u></u>Non-Euclidean methods for machine learning</u> (in particular <u>Geometric Deep Learning</u>)
- I am also quite fascinated by <u>Neural Operators</u>

I aspire to become a research scientist someday and hope to get my PhD in Computer Science. In my pursuit of this goal, I wish to obtain more research experiences in the field of computer science.

I have had the pleasure of pursuing computational chemistry research in the labs of Professor Frances Arnold (2018 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry at Caltech) and Professor Soichi Wakatsuki (Professor of Photon Science and Structural Biology at Stanford). 

My work under these research groups can be found under the repositories tab of this profile. Please check them out!
