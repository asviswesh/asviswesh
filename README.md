- Sophomore at Caltech studying computer science
- interested in applying <u>sophisticated mathematical principles</u> to elevate the <u>precision and robustness of AI models</u> while simultaneously exploring mathematical methods that can expedite AI execution while preserving accuracy

<h3 align="center">Current Research Interests</h3>

My research interests keep evolving (from protein-protein interactions via. a structural biology perspective to applied machine learning for protein fitness prediction to etc.)

Here is what I am currently interested in at the moment.

- <u>Non-Euclidean methods for machine learning</u> (specifically <u>Geometric Deep Learning</u>)
- <u>Neural Operators and ODEs</u>

<h3 align="center">Current Research Collaborations</h3>

I have had the pleasure of pursuing computational research (with chemistry-related applications) with esteemed professors, including:

- [Frances Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/) (2018 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry at Caltech)
- [Soichi Wakatsuki](https://med.stanford.edu/wakatsukilab.html) (Professor of Photon Science and Structural Biology at Stanford)

My work under these research groups can be found under the [repositories](https://github.com/asviswesh?tab=repositories) tab of this profile. Please check them out!
